# Solutions to polynomial equations, implemented and verified in Lean

This code implements and verifies general solutions for quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations in the Lean proof assistant.
There are two versions: a standalone version and one based on mathlib.

## Standalone version

The standalone version is hosted in the directory `non-mathlib`. It works with Lean 3.33.

## Mathlib version

The mathlib version uses definitions and results from the mathlib library.  The files should be stored in the src/algebra directory of mathlib. It works with Lean 3.33 and mathlib commit 18dc1a186.
